# Churn prediction with Machine Learning
## Churn prediction analysis and Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn for a bank with Machine Learning. These predictions allow to set up a targeted strategy for customer retention.

## Models
-Random Forest

-Gradient Boosting 

-XG Boost

-Cat Boost

## Metric
The metric used to evaluate the quality of the model is classification report and confusion matrix.Precision is a metric that quantifies the number of correct positive predictions made. Precision, therefore, calculates the accuracy for the minority class. It is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted positive examples divided by the total number of positive examples that were predicted.

## Results
-Hypertuned Gradient Boosting with SMOTE-ENN

-Final precision score: .91
